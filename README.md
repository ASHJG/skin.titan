 3. Select "Titan MediaBrowser" and hit install
 4. Default installation now complete and you can sit back and enjoy :-)

Beta version repository
 If you want to try out the latest features install the beta repository which is hosted at Emby bacause my involvement in the Emby addon for kodi.
 
PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THE SKIN FROM GITHUB, I WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT !
USE OFFICIAL VERSION FROM KODI REPO OR THE BETA VERSION FROM EMBY REPO ONLY!

Bug reports and feature requests
Feel free to post a message on the forum or send me a PM to get support for the skin, I'll be glad to assist. Also I'm also looking for users with feedback or suggestions about the skin. If you have a feature you would like to see included, please ask on the feature requests thread!
