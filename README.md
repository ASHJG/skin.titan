Skin theme
 The skin's default theme is my own more modern approach of the Titan skin. If you like the classic MediaPortal style better, you can change the theme of the skin to "classic". Open up settings --> Appearance --> Under skin you have the option to select the theme.

Touchscreen support
 The skin is fully touchscreen compliant, actually it even has seperate controls and code to make life easier navigating on a touch device.
 You have to enable the "touch mode" of the skin in the skin settings.

Beta version repository and more information about MediaBrowser integration
 If you want to try out the latest features and/or if you're interested in the MediaBrowser integration install the beta repository which is hosted at MediaBrowser bacause my involvement in the xbmb3c (mediabrowser) addon for kodi.
